# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

â‹˜ â”€â”€â”€â”€ âˆ—â‹…â—¦âˆ˜â—ˆ\[[MissNG Weather Dash](https://missng-git.github.io/WeatherDash/)\]â—ˆâˆ˜â—¦â‹…âˆ— â”€â”€â”€â”€ â‹™

Using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities, I have built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, as well as utilising persistent data stored in a user's `localStorage`.

## â‰« â”€â”€â”€â”€ â‰ªâ€¢â—¦ Objectives â—¦â€¢â‰« â”€â”€â”€â”€ â‰ª

```
+ Help travelers plan trips by retrieving weather data
+ Allows users to research weather outlook for multiple cities
+ Provide user-friendly tool for global weather forecasts
```

## â‰« â”€â”€â”€â”€ â‰ªâ€¢â—¦ Mock-Up â—¦â€¢â‰« â”€â”€â”€â”€ â‰ª

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
